# focusBlur

### What is it for?
To help focus better on the actual content of a page, say a documentation page or an article.
Just blur out the distracting content

### How To Include
Written as an [IIFE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE) this can easily be embedded via [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net) or [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net) but it could just as well be included in a [script](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script) tag. Also copy&paste into development console is an option. Next step will be a chromium extension for easier use.

### How To Use
Press Alt-J to start.
Then select elements to blur out with mouse click. 
Remove blur by clicking again.
Press Alt-K to toggle Control Panel.
Length determines the intensity of the blur.
Brightness determines whether to darken the element.
Press Alt-L to reset blur.
